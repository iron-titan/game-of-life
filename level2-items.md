Level 2: 1Q 2026
Now layered: Big goals + handwritten notes (habits streaks/deductions, money tiers, Upwork/apps, certs, YouTube/articles, driving/gym) + sides (hard-capped: Crypto 1 day, Domains 1 day, Domainenv 3 days spread, Amoeba 5 days spread—all Jan-Feb for portfolio boost). Filled missing XP logically (e.g., scaled from your notes: small 500-1000p, medium 2000-4000p, large 6000+p; streaks/bonuses for ADHD motivation). Tasks grouped (Mains vs. Sides). Daily habits consistent each month—do first for object permanence.
Each month formatted as "one page" (GH Pages ready: copy to jan.html etc.). Hard caps enforced—no bleed. Sides ~10 days total spread (4-hour sessions max, recovery gaps).
